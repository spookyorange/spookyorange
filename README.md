Hey!!, this is Spookyorange.

I am an ambitious web developer who gets the job done. I am interested in Elixir/Phoenix & Linux(generally), and use Django/NestJS professionally. I am also a professional React hater, I do it full-time.

I feel the cold, my eyes are shut, my fear is slowly dying

Light years from here are my thoughts and cages

I can hear their moan, but now a long deep breath is calling"
