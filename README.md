Hey!!, this is Spookyorange.

I am a developer, I used to love Ruby, use NodeJS for work related mostly, but nowadays I'd call myself an Elixir enthusiast.

"And now that you've been broken down

Got your head out of the clouds

You're back down on the ground

And you don't talk so loud

And you don't walk so proud

Anymore, and what for?"
